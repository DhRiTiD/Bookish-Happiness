# <u>INTRODUCTION</u> -

My Application helps solve the problem of financial development of both students' families and our country, INDIA. This app helps students donate their old books that are no longer of their use and help the students who cannot afford these books. The app offers school students the opportunity to donate and/or receive second-hand books using a peer-to-peer app.
High costs of course books and uniforms is one of the main reasons due to which financially weak parents tend to withdraw their children from schools, just because they cannot afford the expensive books and supplies for their children, who then end up in dismay. Thus, this app will encourage children and their parents to get educated and hence, The Youth of the country and the country itself will develop more and more everyday!

### THE CONTEXT -

Being a school student, I know firsthand that paying for tuition, stationery and uniforms is a big financial investment many parents have to make, but unfortunately not only these, there is also the cost of books!

The cost of some important books are very high and the availability at the stores is low. Not to mention, it is very inconvenient for some families to afford such high cost items. 

When conducting the initial research for this case study I found that, on average Indian parents spend approximately ₹4000 - ₹8,000 (and more) per year on books for a junior high school student. I think that this is an enormous amount spent on books only!

In fact, because of the inexistence of an organized platform facilitating the acquisition of school books, students are forced to search their books on multiple online platforms or buy them on physical bookstores which can be a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process.

#### The Problem

School books sometimes represent a big financial investment to the parents/guardians, there is no easy and cheap way to buy them and most of the time we won’t reuse them, sell them or donate them once the course we needed them for is done which leads to a lost investment.

#### Brief Solution

Create a web/mobile application prototype, that can solve the problem of searching, donating and receiving books in a **convenient** and **less laborious** way, by allowing the users to donate the second-hand books for reuse by the students who struggle to pay amounts for the course per year. This will help solve the financial problems and illiteracy in our country, India.
