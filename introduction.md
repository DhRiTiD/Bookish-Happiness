# <u>INTRODUCTION</u> -

My App is a mobile application concept that intends to solve the real-world-problems experienced when researching and selling school/university books and textbooks. The app offers school students the opportunity to buy and donate their books using a peer-to-peer app.

### THE CONTEXT -

Being a school student from a middle class family, I know firsthand that paying for tuitions, stationery and uniforms is the biggest financial investment parents have to make but unfortunately not only these, but, there is also the cost of books!

The cost of some important books are very high and the availability at the stores is low. Not to mention, it is very inconvenient for some families to afford such high cost items. 

When conducting the initial research for this study case I found that, Indian parents spend approximately, ₹4000 - ₹8,000 (and more) per year on books for a junior high school student. I think that this is an enormous amount spent on books only!

In fact, because of the inexistence of a specialized platform facilitating the acquisition of school books, students are forced to search their books on multiple online platforms or buy them on physical bookstores which more often than not is a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process.

#### The Problem

School books represent a big financial investment to the parents/guardians, there is no easy and cheap way to buy them and most of the time we won’t reuse them, sell them or donated them once the course we needed them for is done which leads to a lost investment.

#### Brief Solution

Create a web/mobile application prototype, that can solve the problem of searching, donating and selling books in a **convenient** and **less laborious** way, by allowing the users to donate the second-hand books for reuse by the students who cannot afford to pay amounts for the course per year. This will help the development of the financial status of the families of each student along with that of our country, India.
