# **<u>*The SOLUTION*</u>**

#### MY IDEA

## **HOW DOES IT WORK?**

My app will offer opportunities to students / learners and less privileged people of society to find and collect books from the hub of the respective school or any place they find and see that their required book resource is availble, thus making study easier for learners/students/children who sometimes cannot afford books due to high costs or non availability. 

This app will allow to donat old books or other related material which is no longer of our use, but can help someone in need. The books donated must be under the certain conditions, such as not more than 2-3 years old, 3 images for description are mandatory with small 160 chars description/title/city/address/name of donator, and more as you can see in the slides of '1.5.jpg/PROTOTYPE '

The donated book will then be sent to the particular school/library or any home or address the student can visit in and will be stored there properly, under good conditions. The books will be stacked according to the particular subject and class. All the donated books will be checked from both inside and outside and if the book is scribbled or doodled or torn or spoiled from inside, the particular book will not be accepted. 

The student who wants to select and and receive can go to the BOOKMARKS and can put the particular book in the cart, and so when he/she reaches the school office, address / home etc to reeive book,  he/she must show his/her genuine school ID card where he/she is studying or any genuine proof that he/she needs the book for (just for the sake of genuine person). 

The donated books will be marked as 'available' on the app and will be filtered through class, subject, author, condition, etc.

Here, my motive is to help in the development and education of the students primarily. This app will help us as students, will help environment, resources, country as a whole.  

Growing this app  in future by adding new modules/features will serve as a mode for donation for uniforms, stationary and other essentials that can be donated for those in need and will help the students / learners and book resources can be utilized better. 

I hope this app may grow and serve the people as this above plan.
